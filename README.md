# AdventOfCode

A place to store my brain solution to Advent of Code problems.

I rarely use classes because I try to embody ["Simple is better than complex"](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)

## Solution Requirements

- Accept provided logic tests for early dev sanity checks
- Output Part 1 and Part 2

## Usage

### Testing

Run all tests

```shell
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/
```

Run a specific test

```shell
python3 -m unittest tests/test_year2015_day1.py
```

### Live Run

Run module

```shell
python3 ./solutions/year2015/day1.py
```
